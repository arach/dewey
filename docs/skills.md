Skills are LLM prompts, not code. They're expert instructions that tell AI agents exactly how to perform a task — what to check, what to produce, and what success looks like.

## Built-in Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `docsReviewAgent` | Reviews doc quality page-by-page — catches stale content, missing sections, unclear explanations, broken links | `Use the docsReviewAgent skill to review docs/overview.md` |
| `promptSlideoutGenerator` | Generates AI-consumable prompt configurations for documentation pages | `Use promptSlideoutGenerator to create prompt config for the API page` |
| `docsDesignCritic` | Critiques page structure and visual design — heading hierarchy, component usage, information density | `Use docsDesignCritic to critique docs/quickstart.md` |
| `installMdGenerator` | Creates install.md files following the [installmd.org](https://installmd.org) spec | `Use installMdGenerator to create install.md from dewey.config.ts` |

## Creating Custom Skills

Skills live as markdown files in your project:

```
.claude/skills/
  my-skill.md
```

Each skill follows a consistent structure:

<div class="doc-file-block">
<div class="doc-file-bar">my-skill.md</div>

```markdown
